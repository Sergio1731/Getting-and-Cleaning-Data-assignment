# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-assignment

##What is this project about?
In this project I took data from Samsung that contained information about experiments made on people and recollected the data from the sensors of movement. All the work done in this assignment is in the file run_analysis.R

###run_analysis.R
In this file I read the different sets I was given and then merged each of them. After that, I binded the data recollected from the experiment and added the labels given in other file. Finally, I created a new dataset that had the labels and the data ordered, that is to say, a tidy data set.
Here is a list of the steps followed in this task.
1.-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.-From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
